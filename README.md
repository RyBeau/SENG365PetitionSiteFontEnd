This is the front end of the petitions site I built for my SENG365 assignment. This was my first full website project using Vuejs, since doing it I have learned many better ways to implement the website and make Vuejs code cleaner and more modular. Apart from a few minor deployment bug fixes the project remains the same as when it was submitted.

Note that the backend is running on a free Heroku server so performance for retrieval of backend data is quite slow.
